<summary>FAQ</summary>

### Will this be updated to future versions?

Backporting to older versions is not in the scope of this modpack, nor will it be done.

### Where do I report a bug?
[Issues](https://github.com/Permdog99/Legacy-Remade/issues)

### Can I show this off in my YouTube video?
Go right ahead!

### Can I fork this modpack?
While the GPL liscense gives you permission to do so, I would strongly advice you make your own modpack instead. If you do make a fork, please give the appropriate credits

If a port exists on Modrinth, then yes.

Not at the moment, but if this modpack gets popular enough, I will definitely make one!
